#Program Comment:	This program will take an export of all of the CSP files in XML format (from the export), iterate through each CSP file individually, and allow you to add or change anything within each file. Additionally, you can exclude specific, individual files within the XML export (refer to if statement, and code comments below for usage example on how to account for that)
#
#Note: this will not alter the original file, it just uses it to create a new file (no need to be scared)

#Usage Example: 
#from the command line write:	perl cspScript.pl > yourNewFileName.txt 
#Note: the > redirects output from this script to a new file of your choosing
#	make sure to open the correct file that this Script refers to so that it can get the CSP files (see open FH etc below which are the file handles)


#here just change the file you want to open and go through that contains all of the CSP files (change all of the next 3 lines to the same file name)

				################if you want to print something to go in between each CSP file, this is the place to do it. After the above if statement is done helping out the while loop while iterating through the file, after the while loop goes through the last line of the CSP file, the code ends up here. Hence, if you want to add something in between each file, go at it
